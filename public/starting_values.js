    ingredients: [
      '300g strong bread flour',
      '125g ball mozzarella, sliced',
      '100ml passata',
      '1 tsp instant yeast',
      '1 tsp salt',
      '1 tbsp olive oil',

    instructions: [
      'Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.',
      'Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.',
      'Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.',
      'Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza',

      'Thinly slice garlic. On a lightly floured surface pat out dough evenly with your fingers, keeping hands flat and lifting and turning dough over several times, into a 9-inch round. (Do not handle dough more than necessary. If dough is sticky, dust it lightly with flour.)',
      'Dust a baker\'s peel or rimless baking sheet with flour and carefully transfer dough to it. Jerk peel or baking sheet once or twice and, if dough is sticking, lift dough and sprinkle flour underneath it, reshaping dough if necessary. Working quickly, top dough with sauce, spreading with back of a spoon to within 1/2 inch of edge. Scatter garlic and oregano over sauce and drizzle with oil.',
      'Line up far edge of peel or baking sheet with far edge of stone or tiles and tilt peel or baking sheet, jerking it gently to start pizza moving. Once edge of pizza touches stone or tiles, carefully pull back peel or baking sheet, completely transferring pizza to stone or tiles (do not move pizza). Bake pizza 6 to 7 minutes, or until dough is crisp and browned, and transfer with a metal spatula to a cutting board.',

    instructions: [
      'Combine the yeast with sugar and 220ml warm water in a bowl and stand for 5 minutes or until frothy. Place the flours in a large mixing bowl, pour in the yeast mixture and knead until combined, then add 2 tsp salt. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead vigorously for up to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth, shiny and elastic. Add a little water if the dough feels too dry, but keep in mind that the more you knead it, the softer it becomes. (Alternatively, place the flours in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, pour in the yeast mixture and let the machine work the dough on speed 1 for the first 2 minutes. Increase to speed 2 for 3-5 minutes, then work for 30 seconds on the highest setting.) Tip the dough onto a floured surface, cover with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes.',
      'Stretch the dough with floured hands into a rectangle, then fold into 3 and shape into a ball. Place in an oiled container fitted with a lid. Make sure you use a large container that will allow room for rising. Rest the container in the fridge overnight (or for up to 3 days) to prove and develop flavour and texture.',
      'A couple of hours before you want to use the dough, remove it from the fridge and take off the lid. Cover loosely with a tea towel and leave at room temperature for 2 hours.',
      'Meanwhile, prepare your tomato base (this can also be made the day before and kept in the fridge until ready to use). Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the garlic, parsley stalks and chilli flakes (if using) and cook for 1 minute or until the garlic is light golden and smells fragrant. Pour in the wine and cook over medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes until the alcohol has evaporated. Add the tomatoes with a pinch of salt and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside until ready to use.',
      'Preheat your oven to 220°C. If you are using a pizza stone, put it in the oven now. For this recipe I like to use a large rectangular stone, but you could also use two small ones. Naturally, round baking stones are fine too.',
      'Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll out the dough to a thickness of about 4mm, using either a floured rolling pin or your hands. If baking on a stone, place the dough on a sheet of baking paper. Otherwise, put the dough on a large baking tray lined with baking paper (you may need to use two trays, depending on the size of your oven). Spread the tomato base onto the dough and drizzle an extra 1-2 tbs olive oil all over the pizza.',
      'If using a baking stone, sprinkle the stone with semolina, then place the pizza (still on its baking paper lining) on the hot stone. Bake for 15 minutes.',
      'Meanwhile, rinse the clams again and drain them well. Gently open the door, peel the paper off the pizza base and add the seafood. Bake for a further 5-8 minutes until the base is golden and slightly scorched, the shells have opened and the prawns are just cooked through. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of parsley leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. (If you are using a baking tray, place the tray in the hot oven and bake for 15 minutes. Add the seafood and bake as above.)',

Arrange the toppings in separate quadrants of the pizza: the mushrooms on one quarter, the olives on another, the artichoke hearts on another and the prosciutto on the final quarter.',
